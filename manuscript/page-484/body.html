<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Anthony had actually completed a Chestertonian essay on the twelfth century by way of introduction to his proposed book and Gloria had done some extensive research work on the question of Russian sable coats&mdash;in fact the winter was approaching quite comfortably, when the Bilphistic demiurge decided suddenly in mid-December that Mrs. Gilbert's soul had aged sufficiently in its present incarnation. In consequence Anthony took a miserable and hysterical Gloria out to Kansas City, where, in the fashion of mankind, they paid the terrible and mind-shaking deference to the dead.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert became, for the first and last time in his life, a truly pathetic figure.

Never again would he be able so satisfactorily to bore and bully a human soul.</p></div> </div>
