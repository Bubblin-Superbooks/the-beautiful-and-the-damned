Wilson and his cabinet&mdash;a cabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the twelve apostles&mdash;let loose the carefully starved dogs of war, and the press began to whoop hysterically against the sinister morals, sinister philosophy, and sinister music produced by the Teutonic temperament. Those who fancied themselves particularly broad-minded made the exquisite distinction that it was only the German Government which aroused them to hysteria; the rest were worked up to a condition of retching indecency.

At last every one had something to talk about&mdash;and almost every one fully enjoyed it, as though they had been cast for parts in a sombre and romantic play.</p></div> </div>
