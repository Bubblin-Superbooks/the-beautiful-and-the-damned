It was the only thing I ever wanted badly, Dot. And when I got it it turned to dust in my hands."</p><p>"All right."</p><p>Absorbed in himself, he continued:</p><p>"I've often thought that if I hadn't got what I wanted things might have been different with me. I might have found something in my mind and enjoyed putting it in circulation. I might have been content with the work of it, and had some sweet vanity out of the success. I suppose that at one time I could have had anything I wanted, within reason, but that was the only thing I ever wanted with any fervor. God! And that taught me you can't have anything, you can't have anything at all. Because desire just cheats you. It's like a sunbeam skipping here and there about a room.</p></div> </div>
