They wrote me a letter a few months ago and told me I'd been running too low. Once I gave out two bum checks&mdash;remember? that night in Reisenweber's?&mdash;but I made them good the very next day. Well, I promised old Halloran&mdash;he's the manager, the greedy Mick&mdash;that I'd watch out. And I thought I was going all right; I kept up the stubs in my check-book pretty regular. Well, I went in there to-day to cash a check, and Halloran came up and told me they'd have to close my account. Too many bad checks, he said, and I never had more than five hundred to my credit&mdash;and that only for a day or so at a time. And by God! What do you think he said then?"</p></div> </div>
