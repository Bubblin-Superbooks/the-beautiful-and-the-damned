He found in himself a growing horror and loneliness. The idea of eating alone frightened him; in preference he dined often with men he detested. Travel, which had once charmed him, seemed at length, unendurable, a business of color without substance, a phantom chase after his own dream's shadow.</p><p>&mdash;If I am essentially weak, he thought, I need work to do, work to do. It worried him to think that he was, after all, a facile mediocrity, with neither the poise of Maury nor the enthusiasm of Dick. It seemed a tragedy to want nothing&mdash;and yet he wanted something, something. He knew in flashes what it was&mdash;some path of hope to lead him toward what he thought was an imminent and ominous old age.</p></div> </div>
