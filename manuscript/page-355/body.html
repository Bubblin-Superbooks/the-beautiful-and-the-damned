<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The author, indeed, spent his days in a state of pleasant madness. The book was in his conversation three-fourths of the time&mdash;he wanted to know if one had heard "the latest"; he would go into a store and in a loud voice order books to be charged to him, in order to catch a chance morsel of recognition from clerk or customer. He knew to a town in what sections of the country it was selling best; he knew exactly what he cleared on each edition, and when he met any one who had not read it, or, as it happened only too often, had not heard of it, he succumbed to moody depression.</p><p>So it was natural for Anthony and Gloria to decide, in their jealousy, that he was so swollen with conceit as to be a bore.</p></div> </div>
