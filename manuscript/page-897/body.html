<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In a few hours you'll wake up, my darling&mdash;and you'll be miserable, and disgusted with life. You'll be in Delaware or Carolina or somewhere and so unimportant. I don't believe there's any one alive who can contemplate themselves as an impermanent institution, as a luxury or an unnecessary evil. Very few of the people who accentuate the futility of life remark the futility of themselves. Perhaps they think that in proclaiming the evil of living they somehow salvage their own worth from the ruin&mdash;but they don't, even you and I....</p><p>... Still I can see you. There's blue haze about the trees where you'll be passing, too beautiful to be predominant. No, the fallow squares of earth will be most frequent&mdash;they'll be along beside the track like dirty coarse brown sheets drying in the sun, alive, mechanical, abominable.</p></div> </div>
