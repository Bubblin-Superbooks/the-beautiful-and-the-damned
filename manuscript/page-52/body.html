<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At seven Anthony and his friend Maury Noble are sitting at a corner table on the cool roof. Maury Noble is like nothing so much as a large slender and imposing cat. His eyes are narrow and full of incessant, protracted blinks. His hair is smooth and flat, as though it has been licked by a possible&mdash;and, if so, Herculean&mdash;mother-cat. During Anthony's time at Harvard he had been considered the most unique figure in his class, the most brilliant, the most original&mdash;smart, quiet and among the saved.</p><p>This is the man whom Anthony considers his best friend. This is the only man of all his acquaintance whom he admires and, to a bigger extent than he likes to admit to himself, envies.</p></div> </div>
