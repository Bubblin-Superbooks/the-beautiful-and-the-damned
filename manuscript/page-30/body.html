There was no skimpy glorified towel of a carpet&mdash;instead, a rich rug, like the one in his bedroom a miracle of softness, that seemed almost to massage the wet foot emerging from the tub....</p><p>All in all a room to conjure with&mdash;it was easy to see that Anthony dressed there, arranged his immaculate hair there, in fact did everything but sleep and eat there. It was his pride, this bathroom.</p></div> </div>
