That was all it said&mdash;it didn't say 'what,' it didn't say 'how,' it didn't say 'why.' It just made one single solitary assertion that you and you and you"&mdash;business of pointing&mdash;"could sell. Now my job isn't to make a success of you, because every man is born a success, he makes himself a failure; it's not to teach you how to talk, because each man is a natural orator and only makes himself a clam; my business is to tell you one thing in a way that will make you know it&mdash;it's to tell you that you and you and you have the heritage of money and prosperity waiting for you to come and claim it."</p></div> </div>
