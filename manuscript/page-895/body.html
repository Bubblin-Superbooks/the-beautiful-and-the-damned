<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If you hated me, if you were covered with sores like a leper, if you ran away with another woman or starved me or beat me&mdash;how absurd this sounds&mdash;I'd still want you, I'd still love you. I KNOW, my darling.</p><p>It's late&mdash;I have all the windows open and the air outside, is just as soft as spring, yet, somehow, much more young and frail than spring. Why do they make spring a young girl, why does that illusion dance and yodel its way for three months through the world's preposterous barrenness. Spring is a lean old plough horse with its ribs showing&mdash;it's a pile of refuse in a field, parched by the sun and the rain to an ominous cleanliness.</p></div> </div>
