<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>... I can almost look down the tracks and see you going but without you, dearest, dearest, I can't see or hear or feel or think. Being apart&mdash;whatever has happened or will happen to us&mdash;is like begging for mercy from a storm, Anthony; it's like growing old. I want to kiss you so&mdash;in the back of your neck where your old black hair starts. Because I love you and whatever we do or say to each other, or have done, or have said, you've got to feel how much I do, how inanimate I am when you're gone. I can't even hate the damnable presence of PEOPLE, those people in the station who haven't any right to live&mdash;I can't resent them even though they're dirtying up our world, because I'm engrossed in wanting you so.</p></div> </div>
