<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Four trunks and three monstrous crates were piled in the dismantled room where, two years before, they had sprawled lazily, thinking in terms of dreams, remote, languorous, content. The room echoed with emptiness. Gloria, in a new brown dress edged with fur, sat upon a trunk in silence, and Anthony walked nervously to and fro smoking, as they waited for the truck that would take their things to the city.</p><p>"What are those?" she demanded, pointing to some books piled upon one of the crates.</p><p>"That's my old stamp collection," he confessed sheepishly. "I forgot to pack it."</p><p>"Anthony, it's so silly to carry it around."</p></div> </div>
