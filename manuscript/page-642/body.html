Indeed, I accomplished the not unusual feat of solving each question in my mind long before it presented itself to me in life&mdash;and of being beaten and bewildered just the same.</p><p>"But after a few tastes of this latter dish I had had enough. Here! I said, Experience is not worth the getting. It's not a thing that happens pleasantly to a passive you&mdash;it's a wall that an active you runs up against. So I wrapped myself in what I thought was my invulnerable scepticism and decided that my education was complete. But it was too late. Protect myself as I might by making no new ties with tragic and predestined humanity, I was lost with the rest. I had traded the fight against love for the fight against loneliness, the fight against life for the fight against death."</p></div> </div>
