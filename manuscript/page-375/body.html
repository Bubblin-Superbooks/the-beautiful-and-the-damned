It was a noise from an areaway within a hundred feet from his rear window, the noise of a woman's laughter. It began low, incessant and whining&mdash;some servant-maid with her fellow, he thought&mdash;and then it grew in volume and became hysterical, until it reminded him of a girl he had seen overcome with nervous laughter at a vaudeville performance. Then it sank, receded, only to rise again and include words&mdash;a coarse joke, some bit of obscure horseplay he could not distinguish. It would break off for a moment and he would just catch the low rumble of a man's voice, then begin again&mdash;interminably; at first annoying, then strangely terrible. He shivered, and getting up out of bed went to the window.</p></div> </div>
